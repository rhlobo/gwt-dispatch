gwt-dispatch
============

Provides a centralized communication channel between GWT client and server, 
so that the RPC is encapsulated making it easy to set up both centralized 
exception handling in the client (eg. for threating autentication exceptions, 
etc) and filter-like aspects for the requests in the server.

This lib also encourages the use of good practices and is 
a great choice if you want to make use of Command/Action patterns.
